ChatGPT use cases in Software Testing:
1. User stories creation from requirements (Requirement engineer or product manager)
2. Test cases creation for a user story (Tester)
3. Detect and Correct syntax error in code (Programmers)
4. Detect Correct logical error in code (Programmers)
5. Test automation script writing using manual test case (Automation)
6. XPath locator creation for all elements on a web page (Automation)-Note that ChatGPT free version have data till 2022.
7. Page Object Model (POM) class creation for a webpage with or without page factory (Automation)
8. BDD feature file scenarios creation for a test case (Automation)
9. Utility file creation (Automation)
10. Test data generation (Automation)
11. Code review and understanding the script
So, we canâ€™t create the automation framework as a whole but we can create different components of the framework separately using ChatGPT (or any generative AI) and combine them to create the complete framework.
